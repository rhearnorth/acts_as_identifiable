h1. Introduction

Imagine something specific as this now. You have a list of users and you want to identify one of them without having to enter the exact 100% same user name.

So you use this small acts_as_identifiable plugin to work with your model:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_identifiable :column => 'my_username'
  end

And this is what it will do:

# Search for an exact match
# Search for an estimate match
## If only one user matched, return it
## If not, the user will have to provide more data

I just realize this is hard to explain!

Please rather refer to the <a href="http://github.com/funkensturm/acts_as_identifiable/blob/master/test/acts_as_identifiable_test.rb">Unit Test</a> to see what I'm takling about ;)
